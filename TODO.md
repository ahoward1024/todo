# TODO

## High Priority
- ~~Refactor: checkboxes.
  We need to save the state of all of the checkbox components so we can have a "check all" checkbox.
  Also, it would be pretty helpful so that we can do sorting of the lists, as in what is completed
  what needs to be done, and perhaps even create seperate pages for each, etc...~~
- Hook to (Mongo) database.

## Low Priority
- ~~CSS styling for buttons etc~~ (partial)
- Better styling

## Optional
- List sorting.
- Congratulations!!
- Multiuser? Cookies?
