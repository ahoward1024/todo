# IDEAS

- First, a Flask backend with a React front end.
- Perhaps we use Angular.js or something as a front end too?
- How about a backend written in Rust? https://rocket.rs/
- Possibly a way to navigate to different front ends and back ends?
  (eg. website.com/todo/flask/react/ or website.com/todo/rust/angular ect...)
